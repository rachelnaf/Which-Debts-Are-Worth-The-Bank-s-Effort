# Which-Debts-Are-Worth-The-Bank-s-Effort

In this guided project, I excersice my skills to solve  a real-world data science problem. The problem here, when a bank trying to collect debt on higher level of debt they need more costs as they leverage human resources in more efforts to obtain payments, every level of recovery strategy requires an additional $50 per customer. So I'll try to solved the case to deciding if the extra amount that is recovered at the higher strategy level exceed the extra $50 in costs?
This project helps me gain knowledges in data science skill such as  exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data also statistics in python such as regression.

# Project Tasks

1.  Regression discontinuity: banking recovery
2.  Graphical exploratory data analysis
3.  Statistical test: age vs. expected recovery amount
4.  Statistical test: sex vs. expected recovery amount
5.  Exploratory graphical analysis: recovery amount
6.  Statistical analysis: recovery amount
7.  Regression modeling: no threshold
8.  Regression modeling: adding true threshold
9.  Regression modeling: adjusting the window
